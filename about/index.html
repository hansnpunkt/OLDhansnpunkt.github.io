<div class="about">
			<h1>About</h1>
			<p> I am a computer scientist and applied geoscientist. In Germany, I studied marine geochemistry in Bremen and applied geosciences in Aachen. After moving to Vancouver with my wife in 2013, I worked as a geophysicist all over western Canada for more than 3 years. In 2017, I decided to learn the tools that I had used for so long in the past properly and went to the University of British Columbia to study computer science. 		
		        <br> As a geochemist, I have been on expeditions to the tropical waters of the South Pacific. 
			<br> As a geophysicst, I lead field crews to investigate the subsoil of western Canada. 
			<br> As a computer scientist, I built a universal testing machine and estimated the material properties of sports bras. 
	                <br> I like reading books about the simple life, playing video games and chasing after my kids. </p>
