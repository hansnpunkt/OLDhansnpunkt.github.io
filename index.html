	<h1>Welcome to my virtual world!</h1>
	<p>I am interested in the material properties of our world and how we can measure them. I like building sensors, extracting, visualizing and interpreting data. 
		<br> I can create the hardware and software to do this. I can design new tools in CAD, install them with my hands and think about the data with my brain. 
		<br> As a geophysicst, I have worked in the cold mountains of Canada. 
		<br> As a geochemist, I have been on expeditions to the tropical waters of the South Pacific. 
		<br> As a computer scientist, I built a universal testing machine and estimated the material properties of sports bras. <a href="/about">Read more about my life...</a></p>
